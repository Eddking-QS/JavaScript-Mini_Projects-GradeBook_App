# Mini Project: GradeBook App

## Description

This **JavaScript-based project** calculates the average score for a class and generates a personalized message for a student based on their individual score. It determines whether the student passed or failed, assigns a grade based on their score, and compares it to the class's average. The output is logged to the console. _#freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects_
